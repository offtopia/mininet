## Because apparently just having an IRC channel isn't good enough.

For now:

- Our ASN range is 4212343000 through [TBD].
- Our IPv4 range (for now) is 10.254.0.0-10.254.255.255 (aka 10.254.0.0/12)

- `/asn` contains the ASNs that have been given out. This is in the format as described on https://github.com/freifunk/icvpn-meta/blob/master/README.md - the tools are at https://github.com/freifunk/icvpn-scripts
